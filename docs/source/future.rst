Future Iterations
=================

**Twitter + Statistics = Amazing information!**

And that is why, we want to keep improving. Future iterations of Twitstat will include (but are not limited to)

- A new and improved clustering algorithm to cluster data with higher fidelity

- Get better insights on data by geo-locating tweets and forming heat-maps

- Create gists of each modelled topic for a quick look into what's the most talked about in real time
